For a complete description of the mod and Tool, Armor, and Horse Armor stats, go to the [Standard Materials CurseForge site](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/standard-materials "Standard Materials CurseForge").

This mod is now supported on [Aternos servers](https://aternos.org/ "Aternos Homepage").

## Equipment Stats Logic:
While emeralds are very uncommon underground, many hundreds can be obtained from trading with villagers. Because of this, emerald tools and armor don't have as much durability to make them balanced items. Villages are considered more rare than underground iron, so therefore they're still better items than iron equipment.

Because you must have diamond equipment to mine obsidian, obsidian tools and armor are very durable. Obsidian can be found in abundance from lava lakes underground, so therefore its equipment damage and efficiency is lowered to make balanced obsidian items.

## Creating Textures:
Thanks to [akhenaten](https://www.curseforge.com/members/akhenaten/projects "akhenaten's profile") for remaking the obsidian gem texture for version 1.2.2!

Textures were created based off of color samples from the vanilla emerald texture and the vanilla obsidian block texture.
